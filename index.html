        <div class="subtitle">Proof of Image is a graphic novel, created to introduce you to the blockhain <br>and cryptocurrency world.</div>

    <h3 class="text"> If this book is your first real approach to the blockchain topic, it will be useful because you’ll find out some theoretical basics to understand the technology, and some notions about its applications. If you are already an expert, you’ll immediately be able to understand most of the contents inside this book, enjoying fully all the information, memes, screenshots and thoughts.</h3>

    <h3 class="text5">The idea for this book is to give the basics needed to bring a user inside the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.
      You will find the foundamental concepts of the blockchain and the crypto world, explained in an ironic tone, close to the world of memes; there are some theoretical slides that are overlaid by images, screenshots, insights, illustrations, links, qr code, which invite the reader to look for information, even outside the paper.
      During the writing of the book I reported some of my thoughts about the blockchain and its world, where every day something changes, some news come out and turn all your ideas upside down.
